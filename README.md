# Skyrim SE-VR Save Sync

A basic program I use to synchronise saves between Skyrim Special Edition and Skyrim VR, for personal use but I thought I'd share. Just run the program after you've finished playing, type in which version you want to sync the saves from, and you're done!

## Basic Setup

Before the program runs, you need to identify where your saves folder for both games is stored. Typically, this is found in your Documents, under the folder My Games, which should be automatically created after the game is first run. This location should be entered into the file at `/src/main/resources/mygamesfolder.txt`. For example, the single line `D:\Name\Documents\My Games` works.

I also recommend creating a shortcut of the `out/artifacts/SkyrimSEVRSaveSync_jar/run.bat` file, renaming it, and placing it on your desktop for ease of use.
